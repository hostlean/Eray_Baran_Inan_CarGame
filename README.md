# Eray_Baran_Inan_CarGame


IMPORTANT: I used new Input System for this project. 

If you want to play in unity you should check the box on

Window -> Analysis -> Input Debugger -> Options -> Simulate Touch Input From Mouse Or Pen

//=============//

I used all manager classes from one object.

Car Manager Controls:

move speed, turn speed, car size, previous car count (how many cars will spawn), 

show previous car trails (a trail renderer shows previous cars' path),

show previous car targets, 

wait for previous cars (if player is on the target game waits for the previous cars to go their target)

//=============//

Waypoint Editor :

Has 8 start points and 8 end points they are assigned to their 

arrays simply you can drag from your prefab 

folder to your scene and can design level.

//===========//

There are some buildings in prefabs folder and grass tile and 

their pivot points and positions 

should match under a Vector3.zero positioned object.
